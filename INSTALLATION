INSTALLATION:-

Quick start: Below are OS-specific command-line blocks to install Python, yt-dlp, and FFmpeg (plus Tkinter where needed), followed by simple verification and launch commands suitable for a README section.

Windows (winget)
Install Python for all users and confirm winget is present:

winget --version

winget install -e --id Python.Python.3.12 --scope machine.

Install yt-dlp via winget or pip:

winget install -e --id yt-dlp.yt-dlp
or

python -m pip install -U "yt-dlp[default]".

Install FFmpeg on PATH:

winget install ffmpeg
Note: On some systems PATH may not update unless installing as admin; if ffmpeg isn’t found, open a new terminal or adjust PATH manually as discussed in community reports.

Verify installs and versions:

python --version

yt-dlp --version

ffmpeg -version.

Launch the app from the script folder:

python downloader.py.

Ubuntu/Debian
System packages (Python, pip, Tkinter, FFmpeg):

sudo apt update

sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip python3-tk ffmpeg.

Install yt-dlp with pip:

python3 -m pip install -U "yt-dlp[default]".

Verify installs and versions:

python3 --version

yt-dlp --version

ffmpeg -version.

Launch the app from the script folder:

python3 downloader.py.

macOS (Homebrew)
Install or update Homebrew, then Python:

brew --version (install Homebrew first if missing)

brew install python.

Install yt-dlp and FFmpeg:

python3 -m pip install -U "yt-dlp[default]"

brew install ffmpeg.

Verify installs and versions:

python3 --version

yt-dlp --version

ffmpeg -version.

Launch the app from the script folder:

python3 downloader.py.

Notes for README
yt-dlp official install options include pip, package managers (winget, Homebrew, APT via PPA), and a standalone binary; this README uses winget/pip on Windows, apt+pip on Ubuntu, and Homebrew+pip on macOS for reliability and updates.

Tkinter is bundled with python.org builds on Windows but must be installed separately on Debian/Ubuntu as python3-tk; the apt command above provides Tkinter for the GUI to run.

FFmpeg is required for merging best video and best audio into MP4; the commands above install it via winget/apt/brew and place it on PATH for yt-dlp to use during postprocessing.

If winget cannot find a package or PATH doesn’t refresh, open a new terminal or run as admin; community notes highlight that FFmpeg’s PATH can require admin or manual adjustment in some cases on Windows.
